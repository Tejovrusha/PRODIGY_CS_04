# Task 04 – Simple Keylogger

Cybersecurity Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

### 📌 Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a basic keylogger in Python using the pynput library.
The program records keystrokes and stores them in a local file (log.txt).

⚠️ Note: This project is created strictly for educational and ethical purposes to understand how keyloggers work in cybersecurity. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and against ethical hacking practices.

### 🛠 Features

**Keystroke Logging** – Captures user keystrokes in real time.

**Special Key Handling** – Converts keys like space and enter into readable characters (e.g., space → " ", enter → new line).

**Noise Reduction** – Ignores irrelevant modifier keys like Shift and Ctrl.

**Persistent Storage** – Saves all captured keystrokes into log.txt for later analysis.
